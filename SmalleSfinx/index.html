  <li><h2>Seaming Issues</h2></li>
    <ol>
    <li>Chuck flange vs can countersink 
      <ol>
        <li>Whilst researching broader double seaming resources online, I noticed frequent reference to a metric we've not been measuring: countersink</li>
        <li>We don't have the specific measuring tool for this metric, so I did my best to improvise one</li>
        <li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/3ej9IDs.jpg">[image link]</a></li>
        <li>Seems like our can countersinks are a fair bit shallower than the chuck flange, but all the resources I could find suggested countersink is only a problem if it's too deep.</li>
        <li>Cask doesn't include measuring countersink in it's tutorials and guidelines, is it unnecessary?</li>
      </ol>
    <li>Seam measurement</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Since starting, I've been taking 4 measurments of each dimension in seam assessments, but then averaging it. Whilst reviewing a Canadian government food regulatory board document, I saw that they stressed not to do so. Moreover, an industry seaming record sheet I found online corroborated this by having min/max columns for various measurements. As such, all historical data on our seams taken to date is of questionable use, given that it's all average (pulling outliers back towards the mean)</li>
      </ol>
    <li>Seaming die</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Our seaming die and chuck bearings have never been stripped, cleaned, or replaced</li>
        <li>There's no discernable lateral or vertical wiggling when manipulated, nor visible scoring</li>
        <li>The die visibly need a deep clean</li>
        <li>The gap between closed die and chuck are difficult to measure, the cask manual advises putting the machine into 'hand'mode, but to my knowledge no such mode exists on the operating system we're running (different UI to the one in the manual). As such, I can't keep the die in the closed position for more than a second. Additionally, it's a tight squeeze and looks like it might require a dedicated tool.</li>
        <li>D1 not spinning as freely as D2 <a href="https://i.imgur.com/eRCQuo7.mp4">[video link]</a></li>
      </ol>
    <li>Can observations</li>
      <ol>
      <li>Ping test passed (flicking and denting can whilst against the chuck, then releasing to observe a 'ping' and return to form)</li>
      <li>Light scoring sometimes present on bottom outer seams <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VZ8nZjk.mp4">[video link]</a></li>
      <li>We threw a bunch of cans in the air, letting them fall on concrete to see where they'd explode. Most exploded around the can body, but one looks like it might have been a seam failure. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hlMdFFK.jpg">[image link]</a></li>
      <li>Leaky seam inspection 
        <ol>
          <li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/X3PtIYV.mp4">[video of external observation]</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/TwD2ksF.jpg">image of cross sectional cut</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/hNRiw4C.jpg">[another image of cross sectional cut]</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/zhyqKIY.jpg">[image of post teardown hooks]</a></li> 
          <li>(cover hook min 1.58mm/max 1.59mm, body hook min 1.46mm/max 1.51mm)</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
    <li>SAMS calibration</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Fluttering pressure during operation <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XQichJF.mp4">[video link]</a></li>
        <li>Is this expected and within acceptable margins?</li>
        <li>The air pipe is separated from the air compressor by a good 40m. The compressor maintains a steady (and non-fluttering) pressure of 8.5 bar or so.</li>
        <li>Shared load of pneumatic operations could be dipping the pressure below acceptable thresholds if they happen to coincide, perhaps?</li>
        <li>No signs of moisture, always dry</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
 <li><h2>Filling Issues</h2></li>
    <ol>
      <li>Foamfob troubles with high alcohol and 'sticky' beers</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Certain strong, usually dark, often sweet beers can't be made to foam at regular pressures and temperatures</li>
        <li>Well, they foam, but more like a guinness: gradually, and over a period of being something between beer and foam.</li>
        <li>Obviously this doesn't serve the purpose of a protective foam fob. We've found mixed success in filling at very high pressure (2bar), and filling warmer.</li>
        <li>No so much a technical issue, just curious if you had experience or insight on this issue, and any tips</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Pusharm 1 sometimes sticks, popping violently into position when manipulated</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Not sure how or why it's jamming/sticking, but light manipulation tends to free it (whereupon it jerks suddenly into position).</li>
        <li>I've found extending the arm and rinsing the cyllinder behind moderately effective at temporarily resolving this issue.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Aluminium O-rings & rear fastening caps corroded and calcified (just need replacing I guess)</li>
      <li>Can food-safe grease and lube be used on the lid chute?</li>
      <li>Coils are going great, recurring pinch problem solved with cable management <a href="https://i.imgur.com/cjTA4mR.jpg">[image link]</a></li>
    </ol>
 <li><h2>Equipment and Miscellaneous Issues</h2></li>
    <ol>
    <li>Here's all the spare parts we have <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hR4oxgA.jpg">[image link]</a>, I was going to label them but then I realised I don't know what most are actually called.</li>
    <li>Pusharm 2 infrequently freezes, displaying red light. Resetting the machine fixes this, but why does it happen?</li>
    <li>Your colleague Don Stewart suggested a bunch of spare parts in the support email "Re: Case 00045720 - Spare parts" back in June, do we already have those parts (in the above image)?</li> 
    <li>Do you have a visual catelogue of the various parts with respective codes?</li>
    <li>Can we get this grey square piston for pusharm 1? <a href="https://i.imgur.com/T8Y3cyL.jpg">[image link]</a> - it's leaking./li>
    <li>Don also suggested adjusting the lid-slide dispensation rate, how does one do that?</li>
    <li>In response to an earlier question you had a while back, the push face of pusharm 2 is curved and stepped <a href="https://i.imgur.com/SttoiAB.jpg">[image link]</a></li>
    <li>Pusharm 2 still requires minor 1-2mm adjustments up and down for positions 1, 2, and 3 once a month or so. Not sure if that's problematic, but also don't get how/why these settings would need to be changed once correctly set.
